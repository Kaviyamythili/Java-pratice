Data compression
Liam, a data scientist, is developing a data compression algorithm that leverages bit wise right-shifting as a crucial step. In the compression process, integers are represented in a compressed form. To reconstruct the original data efficiently, Liam needs a program that performs the right shift operation on the compressed data. Can you help Liam by writing a Java program that takes the compressed data and the number of positions to right-shift, then outputs The recovered original data?

Input format:
The first line is the integer that represents compressed data.
The second line is the integer that represents the number of positions to right-shift.

Output format:
The output is the integer that represents the shifted value.

Note:
The code for handling inputs is already been given, your task is to fill in the required code.

//solution

package q22408;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class DataDecompressor{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Scanner sc = new Scaanner(System.in);
    int a = sc.nextInt();
    int b = sc.nexInt();
    int c = a >> b;
    System.out.println(c);
  }
