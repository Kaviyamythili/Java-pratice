Gardening Guru
Ethan is passionate about gardening and wants to track the growth of his plants. Write a Java program that takes the initial height of a plant and the number of weeks it has been growing. The program should calculate and display the estimated height of the plant after the specified number of weeks, assuming a consistent growth rate of 0.5 centimeters per week.

Input format:
The first line is a decimal value that represents the initial height of the plant in centimeters. The second line is the integer that represents the number of weeks

Output format:
The output is a decimal value that represents the estimated final height after the specified number of weeks.

Sample Test Cases
Test Case 1:
Expected Output:
12.5

15.5

Test Case 2:
Expected Output:
25.5
