Sophia, a software developer, is working on a calendar application where accurate identification of leap years is crucial. She needs a program that efficiently checks whether a given year is a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, a leap year is either divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or it is divisible by 400. Write a Java program that takes a year as input and uses a ternary operator to determine and display whether the provided year is a leap year or not.

Input format:
The input is the integer that represents the year.

Output format:
The output states whether the given year is leap year or not as shown in displayed test cases.

Note:
The code for handling inputs and outputs is already been given, your task is to fill in the required code. code in java

//solution

import java.util.Scanner;
public class LeapYearChecker {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int year = sc.nextInt();
String result = ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) ||(year % 400 == 0))? "a Leap year." : "Not a Leap year.";
System.out.println(year + " is " + result);
scanner.close
}
}
